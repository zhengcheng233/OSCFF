; You can define lower and upper limits for determining existence of bond between
; specific two elements in this file. For example, if you add the
; following lines to this file, then if distance (Angstrom) between Fe and Cl is
; >= 2.0 and <=2.4, then they will be regarded as bonded. While if a pair of Fe and C atoms
; has distance short than 2.1 Angstrom, they will be regarded as bonded.
