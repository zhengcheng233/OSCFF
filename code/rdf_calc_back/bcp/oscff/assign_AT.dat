;This file defines rule of determining atom types according to bondings and distances
;The lines beginning with semicolon are comment lines
;
;Each atom type starts with $ symbol, then optionally followed by atomic charge. &
;Specific definitions are given in the next line(s), the following constraint(s) can be used, each one occupies a line
;  nbond: The number of bonds the atom must form
;  element: The element of the atom must be
;  bond: The bonding relationship criteria. The number of terms can be less than nbond. &
;For example, "bond -1 C 2 O 1 H -2 N" means the atom must simultaneously bond to a carbon with aromatic bond (denoted by -1), &
;to an oxygen with double bond, to a hydrogen with single bond, and to a nitrogen with arbitrary bond (denoted by -2).
;  dist: Distance criteria. The number of terms can be less than nbond. &
;For example, "dist 1.05-1.1 C 1.05-1.1 C 1.19-999 O" means there must be two carbons bonding to this atom &
;both with bond length of 1.05-1.1 A. At the same time, there must be an oxygen bond to this atom &
;with bond length of 1.19-999 A (i.e. at least 1.19 A).
;  angc: Angle criteria (present atom is in center). The number of terms can be less than actual number of angles of this atom type. &
;For example, "angc 115.5-124 C H 100-110 C H 120-122.3 O H" means there must be two C-X-H angles (X is present atom), &
;one within 115.5-124 and another one within 100-110 degree. Also this atom should has a O-X-H angle within 120-122.3 degree.
;  angt: Angle criteria (present atom is in terminal). The number of terms can be less than actual number of angles of this atom type. &
;For example, "angt 115.5-124 C N 100-110 C N 120-122.3 O H" means there must be two X-C-N angles (X is present atom), &
;one within 115.5-124 and another one within 100-110 degree. Also this atom should has a X-O-H angle within 120-122.3 degree.
