GROMACS reminds you: "You Dirty Switch, You're On Again" (The Breeders)

Setting the LD random seed to -8392705

Generated 21 of the 21 non-bonded parameter combinations

Generated 21 of the 21 1-4 parameter combinations

Excluding 3 bonded neighbours molecule type 'mol'

turning H bonds into constraints...
Analysing residue names:
There are:   100      Other residues
Analysing residues not classified as Protein/DNA/RNA/Water and splitting into groups...

The largest distance between excluded atoms is 0.396 nm between atom 4048 and 4051

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 298.15 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.005 nm, buffer size 0.005 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.000 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 40x40x40, spacing 0.110 0.110 0.110

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.25

This run will generate roughly 4 Mb of data
